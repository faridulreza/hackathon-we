As online learning and collaboration become increasingly prevalent, it is important to find ways to keep participants engaged and focused. One way to do this is by developing a tool that can detect when someone is mind wandering during an online class or meeting, and provide them with feedback to help them stay on track.

One potential approach for such a tool is to use facial recognition software and a webcam to analyze the user's facial expressions. By analyzing changes in expressions such as boredom or distraction, the tool could detect when someone is not fully engaged in the activity.

Idea: A tool for detecting mind wandering in real-time during online activities such as classes or meetings.
